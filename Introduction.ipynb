    "At this point you only worked with SQL Databases. In other words your data was held in a relational database management system (Basically a scalable csv). This allows you to work with huge amount of data and extract the rows you need using queries.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The context\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't think i teach you something new by telling you that we are surrounded by a lot of data and that information flows faster than ever (i.e: big data). But what exactly is the type of data we get in huge quantity ? Social media and networks, ...\n",

    "## What is noSQL ? SQL vs NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL stands for \"not only SQL\", every database that does not use SQL(Structured Query Language) is called noSQL even though every NoSQL DB do not work the same way. The difference between SQL and NoSQL databases is really just a comparison of relational vs. non-relational databases. Deciding when to use SQL vs. NoSQL depends on the kind of information youâ€™re storing and the best way to store it. Both types store data, they just store data differently.\n",
    "Imagine you have a list of variables for research papers. authors, affiliations, title, references. How do you store it in a SQL DB ? "
