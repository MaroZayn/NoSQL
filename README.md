## Syllabus 

The aim of this course is to teach students a way to store and process non-relational data. Depending on the size but also the problem at hand you will not use the same storage system. You will learn to choose the right format for the non-relational data you have.
During the whole course we are going to use Python as our programming language. We start off with basic unstructured formats like json, xml, dictionnaries. Next we study the most currently used noSQL database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). We finish with alternatives to MongoDB.

- A laptop connected to the internet and running Windows, Linux, MacOS
- Anaconda installed, see below. Choose one of the IDE (I'll be using Spyder)

<a name="Preparation"></a>
## Preparation Before the First Session

- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) if it's not already done. If you have no previous installation of python make sure to add Anaconda to your path. If you want to work with environments please read https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file

- Install [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- Install MongoDB:
    * Windows
        Install it using the msi found in https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community. During install just click next. Chances are your install will be found in C:\Program Files. MongoDB poorly handles the space in the path. I recommend moving C:\Program Files\MongoDB to C:\MongoDB (Make sure that the mongo server is shutdown in the task manager before). Last thing to do is to modify C:\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin\mongod.cfg lines 8 and 19 to the appropriate path.
        You can now start your Mongo Server, open the cmd prompt at this location C:\MongoDB\Server\4.4 and run:
    ```bash
    mongod.exe --dbpath data --config bin\mongod.cfg
   ```
   * macOS
   https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
   
   * Linux
   https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/

- Install MongoDB compass https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass
